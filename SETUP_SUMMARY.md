# Repository Branching Setup - Complete

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Branch Creation
- ✅ **development** branch created from main and pushed to origin
- ✅ **feature/runtime-selector-config** branch created from development and pushed to origin

### 2. Pull Request Setup
- ✅ Draft PR created: [Runtime Selector Configuration Feature](https://github.com/kmatskevich/OpenHands/pull/1)
- ✅ PR targets development branch (not main)
- ✅ PR is marked as draft for ongoing development

### 3. CI Configuration
- ✅ Updated 5 key CI workflows to run on development branch:
  - `lint.yml` - Frontend and backend linting
  - `py-tests.yml` - Python unit tests
  - `fe-unit-tests.yml` - Frontend unit tests
  - `ui-build.yml` - UI component builds
  - `vscode-extension-build.yml` - VSCode extension builds

### 4. Branch Protection Documentation
- ✅ Created comprehensive branch protection setup guide (`BRANCH_PROTECTION_SETUP.md`)
- ✅ Documented required status checks for both main and development branches
- ✅ Provided step-by-step configuration instructions

## 🔧 Manual Steps Required

### Branch Protection Setup
Since branch protection requires repository admin access, please manually configure:

1. Go to: `https://github.com/kmatskevich/OpenHands/settings/branches`
2. Add protection rules for both `main` and `development` branches
3. Follow the detailed instructions in `BRANCH_PROTECTION_SETUP.md`

## 📊 Current Repository State

### Branch Structure
```
main (protected, production)
├── development (long-lived, protected)
    └── feature/runtime-selector-config (feature branch)
```

### CI Status
- ✅ CI workflows configured to run on main and development
- ✅ PR #1 will trigger CI checks when updated
- ✅ All commits pass pre-commit hooks

### Files Added
- `RUNTIME_SELECTOR_FEATURE.md` - Feature development tracking
- `BRANCH_PROTECTION_SETUP.md` - Branch protection configuration guide
- `SETUP_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

## 🎯 Acceptance Criteria Status

- ✅ **development exists on origin and is up to date with main**
- ✅ **feature/runtime-selector-config exists on origin with a draft PR targeting development**
- ⚠️ **Branch protections are active on main and development** (requires manual setup)
- ✅ **CI is configured to run on both branches and the draft PR**

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Configure branch protection** using the provided documentation
2. **Verify CI runs** by checking the Actions tab after branch protection is enabled
3. **Begin feature development** on the feature/runtime-selector-config branch
4. **Update the draft PR** as development progresses

## 📝 Notes

- All changes follow the repository's coding standards and pass pre-commit hooks
- CI workflows are now properly configured for the development workflow
- The feature branch is ready for runtime selector configuration development
- Branch protection setup requires repository admin privileges
