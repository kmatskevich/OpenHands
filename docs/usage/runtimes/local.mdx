title: Local Runtime
description: The Local Runtime allows the OpenHands agent to execute actions directly on your local machine without
  using Docker. This runtime is primarily intended for controlled environments like CI pipelines or testing scenarios
  where Docker is not available.
---

<Warning>
**Security Warning**: The Local Runtime runs without any sandbox isolation. The agent can directly access and modify
files on your machine. Only use this runtime in controlled environments or when you fully understand the security implications.
</Warning>

## Prerequisites

Before using the Local Runtime, ensure that:

1. You can run OpenHands using the [Development workflow](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/blob/main/Development.md).
2. For Linux and Mac, tmux is available on your system.
3. For Windows, PowerShell is available on your system.
    - Only [CLI mode](../how-to/cli-mode) and [headless mode](../how-to/headless-mode) are supported in Windows with Local Runtime.

## Configuration

There are two ways to configure the Local Runtime:

### 1. Through the Web Interface

The easiest way to enable Local Runtime is through the OpenHands web interface:

1. **Start Screen**: When you open OpenHands, if the runtime is set to "local", you'll see a "Select project folder" section instead of the repository connector.
2. **Settings Page**: Go to Settings â†’ Runtime and change the environment to "local".
3. **Project Selection**: Use the folder picker to select your project directory, or enter the absolute path manually.
4. **Restart**: After changing runtime settings, you'll need to restart OpenHands for the changes to take effect.

### 2. Through Configuration Files

To use the Local Runtime via configuration, besides required configurations like the LLM provider, model and API key, you'll need to set
the following options via environment variables or the [config.toml file](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/blob/main/config.template.toml) when starting OpenHands:

Via environment variables (please use PowerShell syntax for Windows PowerShell):

```bash
# Required
export RUNTIME=local

# Optional but recommended
# The agent works in /workspace by default, so mount your project directory there
export SANDBOX_VOLUMES=/path/to/your/workspace:/workspace:rw
# For read-only data, use a different mount path
# export SANDBOX_VOLUMES=/path/to/your/workspace:/workspace:rw,/path/to/large/dataset:/data:ro
```

Via `config.toml`:

```toml
[core]
runtime = "local"

[sandbox]
# The agent works in /workspace by default, so mount your project directory there
volumes = "/path/to/your/workspace:/workspace:rw"
# For read-only data, use a different mount path
# volumes = "/path/to/your/workspace:/workspace:rw,/path/to/large/dataset:/data:ro"
```

If `SANDBOX_VOLUMES` is not set, the runtime will create a temporary directory for the agent to work in.

## Docker Mounting Requirements

When running OpenHands in Docker and using Local Runtime, you must ensure that your project directories are properly mounted into the Docker container. This is crucial for the agent to access your local files.

### Common Mounting Patterns

For **macOS and Linux**:
```bash
# Mount your home directory
docker run -v /Users:/host/Users openhands/openhands

# Mount a specific project directory
docker run -v /path/to/project:/workspace openhands/openhands
```

For **Windows**:
```bash
# Mount your C: drive
docker run -v C:\:/host/C openhands/openhands

# Mount a specific project directory
docker run -v C:\path\to\project:/workspace openhands/openhands
```

### Path Validation

When you select a project folder through the UI, OpenHands will validate that:

1. The path exists and is accessible
2. The path is properly mounted in the Docker container (if running in Docker)
3. The agent has read/write permissions to the directory

If validation fails, you'll see specific error messages with guidance on how to fix the mounting configuration.

### Troubleshooting Mount Issues

If you see errors about unmounted paths:

1. **Check your Docker run command**: Ensure you're mounting the parent directory of your project
2. **Use absolute paths**: Always use full absolute paths when mounting volumes
3. **Verify permissions**: Ensure the mounted directory has appropriate read/write permissions
4. **Restart required**: After changing mount configurations, restart the Docker container

## Example Usage

Here's an example of how to start OpenHands with the Local Runtime in Headless Mode:

```bash
export RUNTIME=local
export SANDBOX_VOLUMES=/my_folder/myproject:/workspace:rw

poetry run python -m openhands.core.main -t "write a bash script that prints hi"
```

## Restart Instructions

When you change runtime configuration (especially switching between Docker and Local runtime), OpenHands requires a restart to apply the changes.

### Docker Compose
If you're using Docker Compose:
```bash
docker compose restart openhands
```

### Docker Run
If you're using `docker run`:
```bash
# Stop the container
docker stop <container-name>

# Start it again with the same parameters
docker run [your-original-parameters] openhands/openhands
```

### Development Mode
If you're running OpenHands in development mode:
```bash
# Stop the current process (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart with:
make run
```

## Use Cases

The Local Runtime is particularly useful for:

- CI/CD pipelines where Docker is not available.
- Testing and development of OpenHands itself.
- Environments where container usage is restricted (e.g. native Windows).
- Direct file system access without Docker overhead.
- Working with large datasets that are already on your local machine.
