# System Diagnostics

OpenHands provides comprehensive system diagnostics to help you understand your setup, troubleshoot issues, and optimize your configuration. The diagnostics system is available through both the web interface and command line.

## Accessing Diagnostics

### Web Interface

Navigate to the diagnostics page in your OpenHands web interface:
- **OSS Mode**: Available in the settings navigation menu
- **SaaS Mode**: Available in the settings navigation menu
- **Direct URL**: `/diagnostics`

### Command Line Interface

Use the `openhands diagnose` command to get diagnostics information:

```bash
# Human-readable output
openhands diagnose

# JSON output for scripting
openhands diagnose --json

# Verbose output with additional details
openhands diagnose --verbose
```

## Diagnostics Sections

### Runtime Information

Shows your current runtime configuration and status:

- **Runtime Type**: `local`, `docker`, `e2b`, `modal`, or `remote`
- **Restart Required**: Whether configuration changes require a restart
- **Status**: Current operational status

**Common Issues:**
- If restart is required, you'll see specific restart commands for your runtime type
- Docker users get copyable `docker compose restart` commands
- Local users get guidance on restarting the process

### Path Information

Displays important file system paths:

- **Config File**: Location of your OpenHands configuration file
- **Project Root**: Root directory of your current project
- **Workspace Base**: Base directory for workspace operations
- **Workspace Mount**: Docker mount path (Docker runtime only)

**Troubleshooting:**
- Missing config file indicates default settings are being used
- Incorrect workspace paths can cause file access issues
- All paths are copyable for easy reference

### Project Memory

Shows the status of your project memory system:

- **Status**: Connected or Not Available
- **Backend**: Database backend type (usually SQLite)
- **Database Path**: Location of the memory database
- **Events Count**: Number of stored conversation events
- **Files Indexed**: Number of files in the memory index
- **Last Event**: Timestamp of the most recent event

**Understanding Project Memory:**
- Only available in local runtime mode
- Provides context awareness across conversations
- Higher event/file counts indicate more comprehensive memory
- Database path shows where conversation history is stored

### Validation Results

Reports configuration validation status:

- **Errors**: Critical issues that may prevent proper operation
- **Warnings**: Non-critical issues or recommendations
- **Status Badges**: Visual indicators (OK, Warning, Error)

**Common Validation Issues:**
- Missing required configuration values
- Invalid file paths or permissions
- Deprecated configuration options
- Network connectivity problems

### Environment Variables

Lists OpenHands-specific environment variable overrides:

- **Status**: Shows if any overrides are detected
- **Override List**: All `OPENHANDS_*` environment variables
- **Security**: Variable values are masked for security

**Environment Override Examples:**
- `OPENHANDS_RUNTIME`: Override default runtime
- `OPENHANDS_LLM_MODEL`: Override default model
- `OPENHANDS_WORKSPACE_BASE`: Override workspace location

### Version Information

Displays version and build information:

- **App Version**: OpenHands application version
- **Git SHA**: Commit hash of current build
- **Git Branch**: Source branch of current build

**Version Troubleshooting:**
- Missing git information indicates a release build
- Development builds show commit details
- Version mismatches can cause compatibility issues

## Status Indicators

The diagnostics system uses color-coded status badges:

- ðŸŸ¢ **OK (Green)**: Everything is working correctly
- ðŸŸ¡ **Warning (Yellow)**: Non-critical issues or recommendations
- ðŸ”´ **Error (Red)**: Critical issues requiring attention

## Restart Guidance

When configuration changes require a restart, the diagnostics page provides:

### Docker Runtime
```bash
docker compose restart openhands
```

### Local Runtime
Stop the current process and restart OpenHands with your usual command.

### Other Runtimes
Restart method depends on how OpenHands was initially started.

## Using Diagnostics for Troubleshooting

### Performance Issues
1. Check **Project Memory** section for database size
2. Review **Environment Variables** for performance-related overrides
3. Verify **Runtime Information** for optimal configuration

### Configuration Problems
1. Review **Validation Results** for errors and warnings
2. Check **Path Information** for correct file locations
3. Examine **Environment Variables** for conflicting settings

### Connection Issues
1. Verify **Runtime Information** shows correct type
2. Check **Path Information** for accessible directories
3. Review **Project Memory** connection status

### Before Reporting Issues
When reporting problems, include:
1. Full diagnostics output (`openhands diagnose --json`)
2. Specific error messages from validation section
3. Runtime type and version information
4. Environment variable overrides (values will be masked)

## API Integration

Developers can access diagnostics programmatically:

```bash
# Get diagnostics via API
curl http://localhost:3000/api/diagnostics
```

The API returns structured JSON with all diagnostic information, suitable for:
- Automated monitoring
- Integration with external tools
- Custom diagnostic scripts
- Health checks

## Privacy and Security

The diagnostics system is designed with privacy in mind:
- Environment variable values are never displayed
- Only variable names are shown for `OPENHANDS_*` variables
- File paths are shown but file contents are never accessed
- No sensitive configuration values are exposed

## Limitations

- Project Memory diagnostics only available in local runtime
- Git information requires git to be installed and accessible
- Some path information may not be available in containerized environments
- Network-related diagnostics are limited to basic connectivity

## Getting Help

If diagnostics reveal issues you can't resolve:

1. Check the [Troubleshooting Guide](/usage/troubleshooting) for common solutions
2. Review the [Configuration Options](/usage/configuration-options) documentation
3. Visit our [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/issues) for community support
4. Include your diagnostics output when asking for help

The diagnostics system is continuously improved based on user feedback and common support requests.
